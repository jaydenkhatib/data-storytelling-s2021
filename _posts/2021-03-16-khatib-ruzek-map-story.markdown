Americans are anxiously tracking [the murder trial of Derek Chauvin](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/03/15/derek-chauvin-george-floyd-trial/), the police officer who killed George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, in Minneapolis last May by kneeling on his neck for almost nine minutes. 

The incident touched off [a peak](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html) in the popularity of the Black Lives Matter movement, compelling national introspection over systemic racism in policing. But a less noticeable, perhaps more insidious effect of the country’s racist history also plagues communities of color: Environmental racism. 

Racial segregation [has meant](https://www.wbur.org/earthwhile/2021/03/05/haverill-merrimack-climate-redlining-maps) that whiter, more affluent populations tend to enjoy less densely packed living situations with cleaner air and better access to trees. Communities of color, however, have historically lived in denser housing, been exposed to more pollutants and have had less access to green recreational spaces (like forests) than white Americans. 

And Greater Boston is no exception. 

“This low investment and active disinvestment was on purpose, and it was due to racism,” said Heather McMann, the executive director of Groundwork Lawrence, a nonprofit that targets environmental racism in the Merrimack Valley. “And we really need to ... offset those [effects] that are still hurting our low-income, our low-resource neighborhoods now.”

Ten Boston-area cities or neighborhoods whose air pollution data are available on the [Environmental Protection Agency’s website](https://www.epa.gov/air-trends/air-quality-cities-and-counties) tell a tragic, familiar story: That communities of color suffer less breathable air.

We analyzed data from 2019, as COVID-19 catalyzed a rise in telecommuting. This [left Greater Boston’s air much cleaner than usual](http://www.bu.edu/articles/2020/no-its-not-your-imagination-the-air-in-boston-is-cleaner/) — but COVID-era restrictions will end at some point, allowing traffic and other activity to flow through communities again.

We concentrated on particulate matter 2.5, or PM2.5, in towns’ air. Scientists have linked PM2.5 to asthma, with [one study by researchers from the CDC and Emory University](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5132644/) finding that residents in places with 14-day averages of PM2.5 levels above approximately 7% — like Roxbury, Dorchester and Worcester — experienced, on average, 4-5% more days with asthma symptoms than people in communities with lower PM2.5 averages. 

Asthma can seriously harm children growing up in a heavily polluted area, and not just physically. [A different CDC study](https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2019/19_0074.htm) from 2019 found that pediatric asthma accounted for 14-18% of all absences in urban elementary schools studied. The study linked this chronic absenteeism to poor achievement and school dropout. 

And COVID-19 has illuminated another pernicious effect: That [asthma sufferers who get COVID-10 have a higher risk of respiratory failure or death](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-77791-8) than those who don’t have asthma. 

Black and Latinx Massachusetts residents are, therefore, likelier than white residents to live in areas with elevated rates of air pollution and asthma and, in turn, [to die of COVID-19.](https://www.bostonindicators.org/reports/report-website-pages/covid_indicators-x2/2020/december/persisting-covid-disparities)

([A Harvard study](https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/83/2013/06/Dorchester_Report_Web.pdf) conducted in 2012 is the most recent indication of asthma rates in Dorchester and Roxbury, neighborhoods of Boston.) 

But there is one exception to the trend — Haverhill. 

The [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219) estimates the U.S. population to be about 76.3% white, yet Haverhill’s population, per the Census Bureau, is only about 69.7% white, making it more diverse than the nation as a whole. So what about Haverhill keeps its residents from suffering the fate that the people of, say, Roxbury do? 

Before we can answer this question, we have to zoom out. 

## Why inequities persist in Massachusetts

In eastern Massachusetts, which contains Boston, a critical source of environmental inequity has been housing. Russel Lopez, a professor of environmental health and justice at Tufts University, noted that people of color [are disproportionately likely](https://www.mapc.org/pollution-disparities-covid19/) to live along major roadways. These increase exposure to pollutants from sources like car exhaust. 

“What we do have are a system of highways and a system of very poor housing that really tends to be the driver of exposure inequities in the states,” he said. 

He referred to [a 2015 Tufts study](https://sites.tufts.edu/cafeh/files/2011/10/CAFEH-Report-Final-2-26-15-hi-res.pdf) that illuminated the racial disparities in highway pollution, namely in Somerville and Boston’s Chinatown. 

Lopez said that pollutants from car exhaust, namely particulate matter 10, or PM10, manifest themselves in asthma but also in [sudden cardiac death](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17522-sudden-cardiac-death-sudden-cardiac-arrest). 

“There are two kinds of heart-attacks. There are the ones where, you know, you wake up in the morning and your arm is numb and your chest hurts,” Lopez said. “Then there’s the other kind … People just sort-of drop dead of a heart-attack. Those sudden death ones have been highly associated with exposures to PM10.”

Furthermore, across the state, people of color live in cramped housing with poor filtration at a higher rate than white people, said Jonathan Levy, a professor of environmental health at Boston University. 

“Communities of color in Massachusetts have higher exposure to ambient air pollution,” he said, referencing [a 2018 statewide study about indoor pollution](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30242266/) he helped conduct. “And, because of differences in the structure of the homes in which they live, have even greater disparities in their personal exposure to the outdoor air pollution.” 

He pointed to two instances of poor filtration: A house being too tightly sealed or susceptible to pollution leaking in. “The question, in part, is, ‘How much of the outdoor pollution penetrates into your home?’” he said. 

But he added that “It’s a double-edged sword. A leakier home lets the outdoor pollution in but it also lets the outdoor pollution out.” 

Levy said environmental disparities are present in rural Massachusetts too — yet they aren’t as severe as they are in densely populated, metropolitan settings, where pollution tends to be higher overall, he said. 

“I think, broadly, it’s — it’s a function of urbanization and urban living and who has been granted access to certain resources and amenities,” he said.

## Combating environmental racism

<img src="GWL.jpg" alt="Volunteers dig." width="500" height="600">

_Volunteers for groundwork Lawrence, a branch of Groundwork USA, plant trees. Groundwork USA._

Groundworks Lawrence targets a problem that many burdened communities share: A lack of forestry. Trees [have been shown](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/127588/1193555819-MIT.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) to increase life expectancy, filter air and lower temperature by providing shade. 

Shade means towns can spend less energy on electricity — the need for air conditioning drops, and so does pollution from power plants. 

Groundwork Lawrence — based in the Merrimack Valley, which contains Haverhill — helped make Haverhill the U.S. city with the second-most-improved rate of tree-planting over the past 20 years, according to [a 2020 MIT study](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/127588/1193555819-MIT.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). 

Lawrence, 42.7% of whose population [is](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/lawrencecitymassachusetts) people of color, used to have New England’s [largest trash incinerator](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.194.8775&rep=rep1&type=pdf) and was at one point [a center](https://www.mass.gov/doc/air-pollution-and-pediatric-asthma-in-the-merrimack-valley-final-report-0/download) for trash incineration and disposal in New England, taking in garbage from all six New England states. 

McMann, the executive director, said of the incinerators that Lawrence had “low-income communities that did not have the voice to really fight them.”

Since then, many parks have been established by Groundwork Lawrence, [like one in 2009](https://archive.epa.gov/region1/brownfields/web/pdf/r1_ss_lawrence_ma_manchester.pdf) on the site of a [brownfield](https://www.epa.gov/brownfields) — or a polluted, decommissioned plot of land. 

“Really, it's social determinants of health. And all those pieces come together. If not, disinvestment continues,” she said. 

One problem with the operation, though, is a lack of air quality monitoring; McMann said she did not have data on how much cleaner Groundwork Lawrence has made the air of communities like Haverhill and Lawrence. 

Levy suggested using satellites or low-cost sensors to measure air quality. 

But he added that the satellite method is fairly expensive and time-consuming, and that the latter is still being developed. Meaning, even organizations that have the financial resources to obtain such technology might not even be able to use it. 

“A lot of community groups have a lot of other things to do than to analyze reams and reams of data,” Levy said. 

But who is even contacted for services like tree installations — which Groundwork Lawerence does for free on people’s lawns — prompts another conversation about equity. 

Lopez described his family’s experience with the [April Fool’s Day](https://www.wcvb.com/article/21-years-later-remembering-the-april-fools-day-blizzard/9209866) Blizzard of 1997, which leveled many trees in the Boston area. Afterward, Lopez said, the City of Boston tried to replant many downed trees — but only people who contacted the city received the service. 

“But we didn’t even know this, right? Apparently other neighborhoods did,” he said, adding, “And I was involved in environmental stuff all over the place.”
